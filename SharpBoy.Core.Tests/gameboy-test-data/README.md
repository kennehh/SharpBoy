# gameboy-test-data

Test data for developers of Gameboy emulators. These files are designed for unit testing the CPU of the Gameboy and don't require any other hardware components to be implemented.

* `alu_tests` - Contains full test data for the 8-bit ALU operations of the Gameboy CPU.
* `cpu_tests` - Contains randomly generated test data for all Gameboy CPU instructions in the same format as https://github.com/TomHarte/ProcessorTests.

Please see the README in each individual folder for more details.
